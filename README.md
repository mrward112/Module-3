# Overview
The following is my own simple version of the classic snake game. I've added different mechanics and effects to the game. A description of each can be found here
Green: The player/snake that will grow once food has been consumed.
Red: the fruit or points that the user collects to grow.
Blue: a buff that allows the player to temporarily collide with themselves. Be careful! it doesn't last forever! Spawns after 3 fruits are collected
Purple: a buff that slows the player down to make more percise movements. Spawns after 7 fruits have been collected


Purpose:
I wanted to experiment more with pygame-ce and become more familiar with the tool as it continues to be developed in the wake of it's predicessor pygame.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Create additional mechanics such as enemies, buffs, and maps
* work out the bug with the Blue buff where I can't pass through my own snake, instead the player just stops
* add a user interface that keeps track of points and buff times
